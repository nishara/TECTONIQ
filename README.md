# TECTONIQ

Modeling territorial knowledge from Web data about natural and cultural heritage

There are basically two approaches defined here. 

Solution1 is based on a MongoDB database with added functionalities and improvements on information retrieval. For example indexing is done based on tfidf calculations. 

The second solution is based on a domain ontology for textile industry. The ontology is defined in the tectoniq.owl file. Crawler.py is for data population and this is written only for image described xml files.
